## About

Hi!

I'm Alla. Since childhood it has been my passion to draw. I have used different media, but during the last couple of years, I have mostly created digital images from my imagination. Every day I try to improve my skills and draw new images inspired by dreams, different characters, other art, cats â€¦ life!

This website is a place for all my work and visitors are welcome to save pictures and print them.

I do it just for fun. It is my hobby. It makes me happy. Please join part of my world and smile with me.
